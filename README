This is a polyrepo approach of the microservice architecture.
Each service is a separate repository. This is the most common approach for microservices.
It is also the most flexible approach. Each service can be developed, tested, deployed, and scaled independently.
This approach is also the most complex to manage. It requires a lot of automation and tooling to manage the services.
It also requires a lot of discipline from the developers to ensure that the services are developed in a consistent manner.
